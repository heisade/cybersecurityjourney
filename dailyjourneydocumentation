  i plan on trying this ethical hacking projects for beginners from github.com/0xrajneesh/Ethical-Hacking-Projects-for-beginners but i ran into some problems cause i didn't have
multiple devices to test on a local Network but i found a way out since yesterday but couldn't complete it because of real life reasons. I will continue today and make sure i get
the online LAN ready so i can start with my projects. I'll be using GNS3 as the platforms for where i will be runing my tests.
