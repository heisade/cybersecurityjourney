  I plan on trying this ethical hacking project for beginners from github.com/0xrajneesh/Ethical-Hacking-Projects-for-beginners but I ran into some problems cause I didn't have multiple devices to test on a local Network I found a way out yesterday but couldn't complete it because of real-life reasons. I will continue today and make sure I get the online LAN ready so I can start with my projects. I'll be using GNS3 as the platform for where I will be running my tests.
  At the end of today, I accomplished a lot in fixing the GNS3. However, I'm still facing many issues, but I'm not backing down at all.

27/Dec/24
  Ok so I plan on finishing fixing the GNS3 today, but I'm going out later today so tomorrow I might be finishing it. So at the end of the day, I didn't accomplish anything. I couldn't even go out today for some reason which is why I have to work harder so I can provide for little things that prevented me from doing some things today

28/Dec/24
  So I want to finish this today, I was able to see something that might be of great help to me in doing this.

3/Jan/25
  I didn't do anything today because I went out today.

4/Jan/25
  I did a lot of work today from 12 am to 4 am but I didn't commit changes to the work I did because my system crashed. Just

  I'm still working on my registration.

10/Jan/25
  I couldn't do much today, but it was a good day. I completed my NYSC registration just in time before the portal closed, and I also got a new PC. Now, I can start pushing more for my pen-testing career with a better tool.

11/Jan/25
  I couldn't do any project today because I was setting up my PC and don't have a Kali here.

13/Jan/25
  I tried installing Kali as my default OS but couldn't. Now, I'm waiting to increase my ROM so I have more space to do everything, but I'll focus on sharpening my Python skills for now.

14/Jan/25
  I have already taken a Python crash course to revise. From there, I will start building Python projects.

15/Jan/25
  I've started the Python crash course.

16/Jan/25
  There is no internet today.

17/Jan/25
  Today I did some Python tests. I asked ChatGPT to give me some questions on the things I've learned and I did well getting 90%

18/Jan/25
  Today I did more Python tests. I asked ChatGPT for more tests. I prefer applying to just learning alone.
