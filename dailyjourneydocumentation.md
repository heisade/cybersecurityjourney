  I plan on trying this ethical hacking project for beginners from github.com/0xrajneesh/Ethical-Hacking-Projects-for-beginners but I ran into some problems cause I didn't have multiple devices to test on a local Network I found a way out yesterday but couldn't complete it because of real-life reasons. I will continue today and make sure I get the online LAN ready so I can start with my projects. I'll be using GNS3 as the platform for where I will be running my tests.
  At the end of today, I accomplished a lot in fixing the GNS3. However, I'm still facing many issues, but I'm not backing down at all.

27/Dec/24
  Ok so I plan on finishing fixing the GNS3 today, but I'm going out later today so tomorrow I might be finishing it. So at the end of the day, I didn't accomplish anything. I couldn't even go out today for some reason which is why I have to work harder so I can provide for little things that prevented me from doing some things today

28/Dec/24
  So I want to finish this today, I saw something that might be of great help to me.

31/Dec/24
  Today I couldn't do much because my laptop charger has spoilt, hoping to get a new one after the New Year celebration 

1/Jan/25
  Just found out today that you can use Wine to run Windows apps on Linux

2/Jan/25
  I didn't do anything today, my laptop charger gave me more problems.

3/Jan/25
  I didn't do anything today because I went out today.

4/Jan/25
  I did a lot of work today from 12 am to 4 am but didn't commit changes to my work because my system crashed. Just 
finish fixing it.

7/Jan/25
  I couldn't do anything today because of NYSC registration.

8/Jan/25
  I still couldn't do anything because of my NYSC registration.

9/Jan/25
  I'm still working on my registration.

10/Jan/25
  I couldn't do much today, it was a good day. I completed my NYSC registration just in time before the portal closed, and I also got a new PC. Now, I can start pushing more for my pen-testing career with a better tool.

11/Jan/25
  I couldn't do any projects today because I was setting up my PC and didn't have a Kali.

13/Jan/25
  I tried installing Kali as my default OS but couldn't. Now, I'm waiting to increase my ROM so I have more space to do everything, but I'll focus on sharpening my Python skills for now.

14/Jan/25
  I have already taken a Python crash course to revise. From there, I will start building Python projects.

15/Jan/25
  I've started the Python crash course.

16/Jan/25
  There is no internet today.

17/Jan/25
  Today I did some Python tests. I asked ChatGPT to give me some questions on the things I've learned and I did well getting 90%

18/Jan/25
  Today I did more Python tests. I asked ChatGPT for more tests. I prefer applying to just learning alone.

19/Jan/25
  Instead of just doing a test today, I built something and took the day off. I built a calculator, and I'll start adding more features over time. I later updated the calculator code to add more features. I also created a password strength checker to be added to my cyber security Python projects.

20/Jan/25
  Today, I did some research about blockchain security engineering and Smart contract auditing, and I think I'm in love because damn. I'll keep you guys updated about the journey.

21/Jan/25
  So it's 12:30 am and I was working on some Python scripts. I started yesterday, so that means I wasn't yeah I worked yesterday and today, lol. It's 11 pm over here and I did more Python scripts. Writing big projects very soon.

22/Jan/25
  I did more revising on my Python. Among all the things I forgot, the for loop and while loop gave me a serious problem today, but I've gotten a hang of them.

23/Jan/25
  My Chrome browsers might be bugged because I can access Github, but the website doesn't respond well on my Chrome browser, but it does on other browsers. Now, back to what I did today: I did the usual: I learned Python and spoke about Web3 and blockchain security to some people to get ideas from them because they are in the Web3 space.

24/Jan/25
  

25/Jan/25
  I tried fixing some codes on leetcode and damn those are some serious problems. I'm gonna try and solve some of them then continue with my learning.
