  I plan on trying this ethical hacking project for beginners from github.com/0xrajneesh/Ethical-Hacking-Projects-for-beginners but I ran into some problems cause I didn't have
multiple devices to test on a local Network I found a way out yesterday but couldn't complete it because of real-life reasons. I will continue today and make sure I get the online LAN ready so I can start with my projects. I'll be using GNS3 as the platform for where I will be running my tests.
  At the end of today, I accomplished a lot in fixing the GNS3. However, I'm still facing many issues, but I'm not backing down at all.

27/Dec/24
  Ok so I plan on finishing fixing the GNS3 today, but I'm going out later today so tomorrow I might be finishing it. So at the end of the day, I didn't accomplish anything. I couldn't even go out today for some reason which is why I have to work harder so I can provide for little things that prevented me from doing some things today

28/Dec/24
  So I want to finish this today, I was able to see something that might be of great help to me in doing this.

31/Dec/24
  Today I couldn't do much because my laptop charger has spoilt, hoping to get a new one after the New Year celebration 

1/Jan/25
  Just found out today that you can use Wine to run Windows apps on Linux

2/Jan/25
  I didn't do anything today, my laptop charger was giving me more problems.

3/Jan/25
  I didn't do anything today because I went out today.

4/Jan/25
  I did a lot of work today from 12 am to 4 am but I didn't commit changes to the work I did because my system crashed. Just 
finish fixing it.

7/Jan/25
  I couldn't do anything today because of NYSC registration.

8/Jan/25
  I still couldn't do anything because of my NYSC registration.

9/Jan/25
  I'm still working on my registration.

10/Jan/25
  I couldn't do much today but today was a good day, completed my NYSC registration just in time before the portal closed and i also got a new PC and now i can start pushing more for my pentesting career with a better tool.

11/Jan/25
  I couldn't do any project today because i was setting up my PC and plus i don't have a kali here.

13/Jan/25
  Tried installing kali as my default OS but couldn't. Now i'm waiting to increase my ROM so i can have more space to do everything, but for now i'll just focus on sharpening my python skills.

14/Jan/25
  Already gotten a python crash course to do a revision on python. From there i will start building python projects.
