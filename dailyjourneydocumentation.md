  I plan on trying this ethical hacking project for beginners from github.com/0xrajneesh/Ethical-Hacking-Projects-for-beginners but I ran into some problems cause I didn't have
multiple devices to test on a local Network I found a way out yesterday but couldn't complete it because of real-life reasons. I will continue today and make sure I get the online LAN ready so I can start with my projects. I'll be using GNS3 as the platform for where I will be running my tests.
  At the end of today, I accomplished a lot in fixing the GNS3. However, I'm still facing many issues, but I'm not backing down at all.

  Ok so I plan on finishing fixing the GNS3 today, but I'm going out later today so it might be tomorrow I might be finishing it. So at the end of the day, I didn't accomplish anything. Couldn't even go out today for some reason which is why I have to work harder so I can provide for little things that prevented me from doing some things today

  So I want to try my best and finish this today, I was able to see something that might be of great help to me in doing this.

  Today couldn't do much because my laptop charger has spoilt, hoping to get a new one after the new year celebration
